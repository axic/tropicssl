= Version 0.6 released on 2007-04-01

    * Ciphers used in SSL/TLS can now be disabled at compile
      time, to reduce the memory footprint on embedded systems

      havege_struct for this processor, thanks to David Patiño
    * Added multiply assembly code for 64-bit PowerPCs,
      thanks to Peking University and the OSU Open Source Lab
    * Added experimental support of Quantum Cryptography
    * Added support for autoconf, contributed by Arnaud Cornet
    * Fixed "long long" compilation issues on IA-64 and PPC64
    * Fixed a bug introduced in xyssl-0.5/timing.c: hardclock
      was not being correctly defined on ARM and MIPS

= Version 0.5 released on 2007-03-01

    * Added multiply assembly code for SPARC and Alpha
    * Added (beta) support for non-blocking I/O operations
    * Implemented session resuming and client authentication
    * Fixed some portability issues on WinCE, MINIX 3, Plan9
      (thanks to Benjamin Newman), HP-UX, FreeBSD and Solaris
    * Improved the performance of the EDH key exchange
    * Fixed a bug that caused valid packets with a payload
      size of 16384 bytes to be rejected

= Version 0.4 released on 2007-02-01

    * Added support for Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman key exchange
    * Added multiply asm code for SSE2, ARM, PPC, MIPS and M68K
    * Various improvement to the modular exponentiation code
    * Rewrote the headers to generate the API docs with doxygen
    * Fixed a bug in ssl_encrypt_buf (incorrect padding was
      generated) and in ssl_parse_client_hello (max. client
      version was not properly set), thanks to Didier Rebeix
    * Fixed another bug in ssl_parse_client_hello: clients with
      cipherlists larger than 96 bytes were incorrectly rejected
    * Fixed a couple memory leak in x509_read.c

= Version 0.3 released on 2007-01-01

    * Added server-side SSLv3 and TLSv1.0 support
    * Multiple fixes to enhance the compatibility with g++,
      thanks to Xosé Antón Otero Ferreira
    * Fixed a bug in the CBC code, thanks to dowst; also,
      the bignum code is no longer dependant on long long
    * Updated rsa_pkcs1_sign to handle arbitrary large inputs
    * Updated timing.c for improved compatibility with i386
      and 486 processors, thanks to Arnaud Cornet

= Version 0.2 released on 2006-12-01

    * Updated timing.c to support ARM and MIPS arch
    * Updated the MPI code to support 8086 on MSVC 1.5
    * Added the copyright notice at the top of havege.h
    * Fixed a bug in sha2_hmac, thanks to newsoft/Wenfang Zhang
    * Fixed a bug reported by Adrian Rüegsegger in x509_read_key
    * Fixed a bug reported by Torsten Lauter in ssl_read_record
    * Fixed a bug in rsa_check_privkey that would wrongly cause
      valid RSA keys to be dismissed (thanks to oldwolf)
    * Fixed a bug in mpi_is_prime that caused some primes to fail
      the Miller-Rabin primality test

    I'd also like to thank Younès Hafri for the CRUX linux port,
    Khalil Petit who added XySSL into pkgsrc and Arnaud Cornet
    who maintains the Debian package :-)
